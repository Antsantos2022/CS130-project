# My CS130 Project Ideas

## Dataset 1: **SuperBowl Ads**
- **Link**: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/2e9bd5a67e09b14d01f616b00f7f7e0931515d24/data/2021/2021-03-02 
- **What it contains**: Descriptions of Super Bowl ads based on their YouTube video, between 2000 and 2020 

- **Question 1**: Which type of ads have the most success during the Super Bowl?
  (Also, how much money these ads convert into sales for a company. ) 
            I can use the dataset that contains the conversion rates for such commercials and compare and contrast them with others.

  - **Question 2**: Does increasing the budget for an ad increase conversion?
  - (Similarly, I can compare the budget of an ad and compare it to its conversion rate. Also, looking into low-budget ads that had success could help understand if it helps more.)

## Dataset 2: **Video Games**
- **Link**: [video_games.csv](https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/csv/video_games/video_games.csv)
- **What it contains**: Sales, ratings, and details for 10,000+ games
  
- **Question 1**: Which game genre makes the most money?
- This question would be easy to answer. I can compare the game genres that make the most money and find similarities. Using the dataset would be helpful to also look at those games' reviews.

 - **Question 2**: Do high-budget games get better reviews?
  - I feel like answering this question would involve me diving in to big-budget games and their reviews. Also, comparing indie games to triple-A games would give me a good idea.
